**Over-communicate and take your time before replying**

Communication is the blood of remote workers. Keep it flowing. Getting a lot of messages from others can overwhelm you. I’d suggest you keep calm and deliberately put a delay of 5–10 min before committing to anyone or replying to their queries. Replying after reading carefully and patiently helps in understanding them or their requests better.

**Respect everyone’s time and understand working asynchronously**

I believe the sole reason developers wish to work remotely is that they want their own space and time to solve problems. Problems here can be personal as well as professional. Understand the fact that it’s okay to wait for others to approve of your suggestions or requests to any particular thing related to work. Perhaps make use of your world clock app and being polite will serve you well in the long run.

**Being self-driven help**

This is my personal favorite. When you are in the iteration phase of your existing applications and solutions, it is a no-brainer to wait for someone to assign tasks to you. Unless your organization has more than 10 developers.

Just declare whichever task you are picking up to your team or maybe create a PR and share its link on your respective communication channels.

**Work-life balance will happen to you**

Oh yeah! if you manage to continue working remotely within a month or two you’ll end up finding ways to balance the two.

**Workout and eat right**

Helps in bringing you back to the civilization.

**Read books**

Not just any books, read things that are relevant to your real life problems or maybe references for being more productive. Also, try to read books that are really interesting for you to read otherwise it gets tough to finish them.

**Travel**

Go and meet new people at different locations. It’s refreshing and raises your productivity levels.

**Pre-assumptions**

Don’t.
