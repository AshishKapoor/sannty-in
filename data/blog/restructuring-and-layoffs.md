### Restructuring and Layoffs (Adversity is the way!)

\[Disclaimer\] I’m not an expert. However, I’ve revived through this cycle once. Maybe you should open up and talk about it with your close ones first.

Being handed over a _pink_ _slip_ is tough! Losing a job is NOT an end to anything. It’s not under your control to have a stable journey through an economy meltdown.

Some of you might end up on a clock with your visas, bills, or up-coming expenses.

Okay, maybe have your favourite drink to calm yourself down. First night you might go sleepless. It’s all normal to over-think and be confused. **Focus** on what you have to offer as value and how to fix the “situation” that you’re in.

**Let’s look at the positives**

There are always companies out there ready to consume people of your skill set. Since your ex-employer **needed** you at one point of time too!

Also, there’s nothing wrong in opening up about your situation with your potential employer. Their empathetic reaction to it will give you a nice understanding of their company culture and people. Makes it easy to pick the right employer for yourself.

Plus, probability of landing a better job of interest is high!

**Note:**

Maybe it's a much needed break from the "rat race". Time to re-evaluate your goals and aspirations. Maybe, if you’ve got enough savings in the bank, start your own venture you always dreamt of.

All the best!
