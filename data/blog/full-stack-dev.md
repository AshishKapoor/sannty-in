I have been a frontend developer in Mobile(iOS) and Websites for over a decade now.
I crave to get the taste of the backend from the past 3 years over holidays and weekends.

Being in the front end I was always inclined towards javascript/typescript in the backend.
I went from NodeJS to ExpressJS to Koa where I realised the developer experience(DX) was a lot
demanding and did not appear like a weekend affair.

While recently working alongside a long-time friend. I noticed him advocating for Django (Python-based framework) a lot.
Where I noticed he was able to manage a team of 2 and lead multiple products swiftly with a happy face most of the time.

_I started questioning my tech stack of Node/Express, Postgres, React, and Nginx._

All self-hosted. Oh yeah, I spent years in Computer Networks to accumulate practical knowledge
from DNS, TCP/IP, cloudflare, Nginx Proxy Manager, wireguard, docker, docker-compose, grafana, and to ubuntu server, cockpit and proxmox.
I ended up eventually streaming videos on demand from anywhere across the globe for myself using Oracle Cloud (Because JioCinema was a horrible OTT service back then).

Coming back on the search for a web backend framework which plays nice with a weekend’s worth of time.
Since a lot of my time investment went into the node, express, koa, system design, and backend systems.
I realised it was not a waste of time after all because the architecture was almost the same across all frameworks.
I noticed unlike in the front end at least in the backend things were mostly the same with minor differences in philosophy and ways of doing the same things.

Then with a simple introduction to [Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/AshishKapoor/django-rest-framework) the promise of DX helped me double down on giving my all free time to devote to Python & SQL > Django > DRF.
The major benefits of not having to worry about pointers and references in python were just a no-brainer. Special mention of the pythonic way of doing things.

**Note:**
Having basic clarity of things like HTTP, IP, model-based ORMs, Virtualisation, Docker, and K8s. Then clarity through [Budibase](https://budibase.com/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) with some technicalities of tables and relationships. I am super confident to invest my free time into Python land. Plus after witnessing my colleague fine-tuning and caching. It just makes sense this is the best way forward for me!

It makes sense statistically as well. Since JS/Python communities are top communities to learn and grow.

The pros of going through this process that I can see are

- I might be able to write services on the web.
- I might be able to fiddle with 3rd party [Python AI/ML libraries](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) which will make ML highly accessible to me.
