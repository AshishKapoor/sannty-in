So, I have been playing Fortnite a lot with my friends from time to time. One great thing I noticed in the game was the ability to switch weapons using the numbers on the keyboard right above the \`w\` \`a\` \`s\` \`d\` keys.

It becomes super simple to switch between weapons while playing the game instead of switching with the mouse wheel option which is linear in nature and eventually leads to a confused state.

So I took inspiration from i3 Windows management from our friends in Linux and at my work laptop which is on Mac OS.

I installed [Amethyst](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/) (sounds like Aim Assist to me lol) to bring all the windows on a desktop in an order (tall, column, wide, etc).

Then I made use of Mission Control given to us by the lords of Apple themselves. Went into the keyboard settings and hooked these shortcuts up for easy switching. [While disabling the recently used App switching mechanism by Apple to take manual control altogether](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254094472).

Then I started assigning the app windows to certain Desktop numbers using the following settings -> “This Desktop”:

Awesome! No more alt + tab fiddling experience.

I press ctrl + 1, I always get my VS Code editor.

I press ctrl + 2, it always gives me my terminal.

I press ctrl + 3, it always gives me the browser of my choice.

So on and so forth, I hope you get the point.

Thanks for reading, cheers!
