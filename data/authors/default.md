A tech enthusiast with a focus on developing and maintaining software. Committed to delivering reliable solutions with a customer-first approach. Open-source contributor and YouTuber in my free time.

I specialize in TypeScript, REST, Web Performance, and Mobile Applications, and I love making complex computer science concepts accessible to anyone interested in technology through my Youtube videos.

I've been a full-time software engineer since 2014, and I've had the opportunity to work with some incredible startups ranging from pre-seed to Series A, which has been an amazing learning experience for me, both in terms of technology and business. Since 2022, I have been focusing more on back-end, site reliability, and system architecture to improve my people skills and get out of my coding comfort zone.

In my free time, I like to challenge myself to be more creative and improve my tech skills by writing in-depth product requirement documents on improving existing technologies/product.
