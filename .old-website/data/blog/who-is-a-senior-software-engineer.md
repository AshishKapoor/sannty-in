It all began with my following dev.to [post](https://dev.to/ashishkapoor/who-is-a-sr-software-engineer) dated September 16, 2017. It’s when I turned curious around this question to get an understanding and plan for my own engineering career roadmap.

While agreeing with the contextual answer on my [post](https://dev.to/ashishkapoor/who-is-a-sr-software-engineer), I’d like to share some of my own experiences.

In my opinion, a senior software engineer is who has the potential to unblock other team members and can lead with empathy, while giving the right direction to other team members.

Also, I’ve noticed by showing confidence in, sharing knowledge, and occasionally challenging your team members with interesting problems that add value to the company leads to a healthy work culture while generating growth opportunities for all.
