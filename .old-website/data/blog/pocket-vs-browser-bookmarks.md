I put a stop on my forever quest of finding the best way to keep reading and stay updated.

So, I asked my friends and literally the world on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ashshkapoor/status/921430725097693184).

Where on earth should I keep the awesome articles I come across and what is the right time to read them?

`Answer to the first question is:`

**Don’t**. unless its something worth keeping for later try pocket/browser’s bookmark. See, the information is dynamic in nature. Read it, get it, move on to the next one.

`Answer to the second question is:`

**Date.now();** Otherwise you might end up with 5000+ or more articles unread on your Pocket account or Browser’s Bookmarks and probably irrelevant piece of information the time you get on to them.
