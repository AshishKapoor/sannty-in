I grew up in New Delhi, India where I spent 25 years. I’ll be honest, I miss my city a lot. However, due to many reasons, I left my convenient, easy lifestyle and somehow the need for simplicity brought me down here in a small city Vadodara, Gujarat. I believe to some extent I’m following the geo-arbitrage concept.

Honestly, in the time span of three and a half months, I have noticed a lot of little things we fast-paced city guys never give a deep thought over.

To list a few:

**Mystical bond kids have with their parents.**

I’ve noticed kids are closer to their parents, and likewise. Parents tend to give freedom when the environment for their kids appear to be more on a safer side. Leads to a healthier upbringing in my opinion.

**New languages.**

I come across people who prefer talking in Gujarati and Marathi languages other than Hindi. At first, I used to feel like bonkers! what the hell are they talking about? These days I just tend to get an idea where the conversation is heading. Never the less, most of the times I just ask. Funny, one can best judge a new place on basis of how the natives react when you ask for some translations.

**People are slow and relaxed.**

Small city people have a simple lifestyle. Most of them aren’t really in the “rat race”. Talking about fulfilment, I believe they know what they are doing.

For a newcomer, it takes a little while to appreciate especially if you are coming from a fast-paced big city. It’s actually as simple as a litmus test, you can either bear it(adjust) or just end up packing your bags and leave the very next moment.

**Dry state effect: the good, the bad, and, the ugly.**

Apparently, I chose a limited edition dry state out of the remaining 28 states of India. I know right? At first, I was like no way! I’m a Punjabi guy I cannot live without alcohol running down my gut every weekend.

Now, I embrace the fact that I’m not. There’s always one addiction though, talking about addictions I tried smoking for a while and realised quite early on that it’s just not my thing. When I run the numbers I save some bucks on such recreational methods.

I miss my favourite economical clothing brand though i.e. H&M.

Weekends are horrible. Weekdays are fun! you guessed it right this is the ugly part. I’m trying to do what others over here do for leisure and entertainment. Watching movies, eat good food. Oh Boy! the food over here is good and value for money.

**Little things.**

Girls feel safer late at night out in the streets. I being a guy used to avoid going out for a walk or a run late at night in Delhi myself.

Silence, people don’t honk much on the streets. I guess maybe my place is blessed with silence and decency around noise pollution.

It’s one of the least polluted areas of India one thing I take pride in.

Welcoming neighbours, I tell you honestly whenever I run out of groceries and feeling lazy on the top of it. My doorbell magically rings with food on the other end.

Lastly, if you are new in Vadodara, Gujarat, India or some new place in the world, feel free to share your experiences. I’d love to hear/read them in the comments.
