Dear Reader,

A happy new year to you and your family.

I’m in a phase of my life where apart from just getting better in computer science, it has been a massive one for self-discovery, self-awareness, and self-improvement for me.

TL;DR?

[Read this instead](https://twitter.com/AshishKapooor/status/1076448217192124416?s=20).

I’ve gained knowledge in or mastered:

**Cooking**

All thanks to my friend’s mom. I got to learn the basics. Then I gave it a spin in my own lab(Kitchen) I’ll be honest, initially, the output or results were simply horrible yet I kept admiring it even then. I guess iteration concept worked out well and now I know how to cook a decent breakfast, lunch, and dinner for myself. Lately, I’ve been experimenting with oregano, makes my meals interesting with some cheese.

**Financial literacy**

Read 4 books **Rich dad poor dad**, **Unshakable**, **The Total Money Makeover,** and **Misbehaving**: The Making of Behavioural Economics**.** I found these to be enough for starters to understand the topic and an [article](https://www.suredividend.com/charlie-munger-quotes/) that I was able to understand after going through all 4 books mentioned here.

**Living alone**

Oh boy! Here’s a kicker, I work remotely so I planned on moving out of Delhi (Dil waalon ki Dilli) and moved to Vadodara, Gujarat. After 2 months of getting the essentials in place. One fine night post-dinner I just realized the progress I’ve made so far, how I went from nothing to everything(mostly) all by myself and some help from my friend(TBH).

The first 2–3 weeks were horrible I’ll be honest, but then you get into the vibe of living alone. You get to understand so many things and concepts about stuff you’ve never ever focused upon.

**10 Km Run**

So the city I’m living in currently is a dry state(Alcohol is banned). I’m a Punjabi guy for whom alcohol consumption over weekends is a casual affair. However, after living here for over 3 months, I came to realise there are so many things in life you can do instead of just going out with friends and party over weekends. Out of which one single example is 10 Km run I completed recently in 1 hour 43 minutes approx. I know it isn’t really any close to a record but hey a 10 km run in a single go. There are so many other things like reading stuff you love to learn more about. Watching Netflix and TV series is not really my thing I call it a cheat night if I tend to do it. I mean come on! I cannot completely ignore it.

**Travel abroad**

Oh Oh! I finally got an opportunity to travel out of India for the first time. It made me realize a different aspect of life as a traveler. After 17–18 hours of the journey(one side). From passing out at Airport terminals, and the cab drives to trying new cuisines. It was something new.

_I’ve still got a dream of experiencing a decent beach somewhere in the world._

Thank you 2018 and Hello 2019!
