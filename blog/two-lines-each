Survival is an act of quiet rebellion.

Freedom terrifies people more than chains.
Guilt is the soul refusing to lie to itself.

Life makes no promises, so meaning is your job.
Defiance is dignity in an absurd universe.

### Franz Kafka

The system does not hate you.
It simply does not notice you dying inside it.

### Virginia Woolf

A woman needs space before she needs permission.
Inner lives matter even when the world ignores them.

Power survives by corrupting language first.
Truth becomes dangerous when everyone agrees to forget it.

Society punishes sincerity more than cruelty.
Style is truth told with a smile and a knife.

### Edgar Allan Poe

The mind is its own haunted house.
Reason cracks fastest when terror whispers politely.

Love remembers what history tries to bury.
Redemption often arrives too late, but it still counts.

### Leo Tolstoy

Great suffering grows from ordinary selfishness.
Moral clarity is harder than heroism.

### Emily Brontë

Love untamed becomes a storm, not a shelter.
Nature understands passions people pretend not to have.

### Ted Hughes

Violence is often just honesty without manners.

Love is political even when whispered.
Desire gives language a pulse.

Evil adapts faster than morality.
Fear survives because we invite it inside.
