It is a _slow_ process.

First, we write silly code then probably something that works. We learn what we were telling our “dumb” computer. All of a sudden we learn about mistakes like global variables and how bad they are.

Then we gain some wisdom and call ourselves Jon Snow of tech. We start automating our own work and call it smart work. Soon, we start visualising patterns and different ways of solving similar problems efficiently (Big O nerds hit the clap button! :D).

One fine day we realise languages, and frameworks are basically tools and we are all **problem solvers**.

> Understanding when and where to use them to provide value is the key.

Maybe, I’m wrong. Who knows! I’m Jon Snow.
